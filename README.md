Code used for analysis of viral barcode libraries. Code used for analyzing one-plasmid and ten-plasmid controls is in the `controls` directory. Code used for analyzing the plasmid, ligated, and viral libraries is in the `stock` directory. Code used for analyzing barcodes in mouse urine and tissue is in the `urine_and_tissue` directory. The `notebook_combined_stock_bcs.org` file is an Emacs Org Mode file that describes the steps used to extract barcodes from the sequencing libraries using `cutadapt`, cluster the barcodes using `Starcode`, etc.
